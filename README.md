Designed with simplicity in mind, TextDungeon is an open source project 
which lets people store any amount of text for personal safe-keeping 
with only a name and password.
   
All plain-text is encrypted using AES-GCM-256 with the help of BCrypt. Everything is properly salted using a secure random algorithm. 
   
What makes TextDungeon.io somewhat unique is the lack of ANY JavaScript or even Cookies.

It also goes without saying that no meta-data or personal user information is ever logged.
(This includes your IP address, browser fingerprint, operating system, password hash, etc.)
